# shopping-cart
A Shopping Cart built in React 

I was asked to build a shopping cart for a technical test , given one day to complete it.

The cart is working but my aim is to use this as a learning ground to keep adding up to date React features and implementing the latest standards and practices to further and hopefully help others with a similar task. 

As each new feature is implemented, and the app gets a to a new version i will be creating seperate branches to show my progress whilst building the app and different stages it has gone through.

# Installation
Built using create-react-app simply clone and run yarn install, and you should be good to go.

## Current Status
- The basic Version 1.0 of this app has a table of products , which you can add to a cart.
- The cart then calculates the total of items.
- You can remove an item, and the total will update. (Same for adding an item)
- There is a clear all button for removing all items.

## Aims/Goals for this project 

- [ ] Fix a known bug where the first item is set to 0 , this would be done by checking the state is being updating correctly.
- [ ] Improve the UI layout 
- [ ] Add real API request for Products Data
- [ ] Re-Factor codebase primarily, checking wether any Stateful component data or logic can be moved into a Stateless Functional Component.


..... More to come :)
